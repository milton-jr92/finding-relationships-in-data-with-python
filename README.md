# linear-relationships-and-correlation

project implemented as a course path activity "Interpreting Data with Python". The activity consists of identifying the correlation coefficient that evaluates whether there is a linear relationship between two continuous variables. A kaggle dataset - Bike Sharing - was used to explore the different ways of visualizing the correlations between attributes.

The Bike Sharing Dataset:
Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions,
precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors.
